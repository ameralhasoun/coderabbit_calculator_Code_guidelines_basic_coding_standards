# Code Review Agent Rules (AGENT.md)

These rules override CodeRabbit's default behavior. Follow them strictly in all reviews.

## 🔧 Naming Convention Rules (Override)

1. **Override Default Rule**  
   Public methods in this repository **MAY use snake_case**.  
   Do not recommend converting snake_case to PascalCase.

2. **Reviewer Instruction**  
   If you have read these rules, include this sentence at the end of your review:  
   **"AGENT.md rules applied ✅"**

3. **Violation Handling**  
   Only mention naming as an issue if it violates the rule above.
